# adhoc routing DSDV = Destination-Sequenced Distance-Vector Routing (DSDV) 
#                   -is a table-driven routing scheme for ad hoc mobile networks based on the Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm. 
# 
# LL = Link Layer , phyType=Physical Layer Type
#
# ifqType = Interface Queue type , ifqLen = Interface Queue Length
#
# channelType =  Channel to be used for communication(Wired/Wireless)
#
# propType =  Propogation Type of the signal 
#               -The Two-Rays Ground Reflected Model is a radio propagation model which predicts the
#                path losses between a transmitting antenna and a receiving antenna when they are in LOS (line of sight).
#                Generally, the two antenna each have different height.
#
# antType = Antenna Type
#           -Omni Antenna :  is a class of antenna which radiates equal radio power in all directions perpendicular to an axis,
#                            with power varying with angle to the axis, declining to zero on the axis.
